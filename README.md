# python_keras_demo

##Functions: 

This is a small collection of programs I've used to training and test deep learning models to classify data collected by a collaborator. New users of 
keras and tensorflow can use this code as an example of integrating multiple features of those packages into a basic analysis pipeline. More 
experienced users can build on this backbone to produce more sophisticated analytic fraemworks.
